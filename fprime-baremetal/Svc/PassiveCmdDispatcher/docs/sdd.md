# Baremetal::PassiveCmdDispatcher

A passive component for dispatching commands. Designed as a pared-down, passive replacement for
[`Svc::CmdDispatcher`](../../CmdDispatcher/docs/sdd.md).

## Assumptions

The implementation of `Baremetal::PassiveCmdDispatcher` makes the following assumptions:

1. Only one invocation of any given input port is made at a time. This is essential for the memory coherency of the component's data structures.
